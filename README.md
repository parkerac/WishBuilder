# WishBuilder

Thousands of biology-related datasets are publicly available on the Web. Commonly, researchers want to filter individual datasets to include biological samples that meet specific criteria and examine data for a few variables (e.g., genes, proteins) at a time. Unfortunately, researchers often have a difficult time performing these tasks because datasets are large in size and stored in a wide variety of formats.

To address this problem, we are developing [Geney](http://piccololab.byu.edu), a Web-based tool that enables researchers to query such datasets in a consistent and easy manner. As a way to get data into Geney, we are developing WishBuilder, a companion system that parses and standardizes publicly available data. WishBuilder downloads data from public Web servers, reformats the data, and stores it in a consistent, queryable format. To facilitate this process, we are enlisting students and other interested researchers to write WishBuilder scripts. The more datasets we prepare, the more useful Geney will be!
